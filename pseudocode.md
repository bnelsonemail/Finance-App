## Pseudocode

### User Authentication (Auth0)

1. Set up Auth0 application and store client credentials in `.env`.
2. Define login and logout routes:
   - **Login**: Redirect user to Auth0’s OAuth login page.
   - **Callback**: Handle Auth0’s callback, validate tokens, and create a session.
   - **Logout**: Clear session and redirect to Auth0’s logout.

### Dashboard

1. **Fetch Data**: Retrieve user’s budgets and debts from the database.
2. **Calculate Metrics**:
   - Total expenses by category.
   - Progress toward debt repayment goals.
3. **Render Dashboard**: Display metrics and progress bars.

### Budget Tracker

1. **Category Setup**: Allow users to define categories and subcategories.
2. **Track Expenses**: For each category, track individual expenses.
3. **Calculate Totals**: Automatically compute totals for each category.

### Debt Payoff Tool (Snowball Method)

1. **Input Debt Details**: Collect debt balances, APRs, and minimum payments.
2. **Fetch Disposable Cash**: Retrieve extra cash from the budget tracker.
3. **Repayment Strategy**:
   - Prioritize smallest debt.
   - Apply disposable cash to pay off the smallest debt.
   - Continue to next debt when the smallest is paid off.
4. **Calculate Payoff Date**: Estimate the debt-free date based on payments.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Configuration
1. **Initialize Git Repository**: Set up version control.
2. **Create Virtual Environment**: Set up Python environment using `venv`.
3. **Install Packages**: Install Flask, Auth0 libraries, SQLAlchemy, and other dependencies.
4. **Configure `.env`**: Add Auth0 credentials, database URI, and secret key.

### Phase 2: Authentication Setup
1. **Register Application on Auth0**: Obtain Client ID, Client Secret, Domain, etc.
2. **Set Up Flask-OAuth**: Integrate Auth0’s OAuth service using `authlib`.
3. **Create Authentication Routes**:
   - `login`: Redirects to Auth0’s login page.
   - `callback`: Auth0’s callback route, handles session creation.
   - `logout`: Clears session and logs the user out.

### Phase 3: Database and Models
1. **Define Models**:
   - **User**: Stores user data, linked with Auth0 ID.
   - **Budget**: Stores budget categories and amounts.
   - **Debt**: Stores debt details, including APR, balance, and minimum payment.
2. **Migrate Database**: Use Flask-Migrate to initialize and create database tables.

### Phase 4: Dashboard
1. **Dashboard Route**: Render a summary page with budget and debt data.
2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Calculate total expenses and remaining cash.
   - Display debt repayment progress.
3. **Visualization**: Use progress bars and charts for a visual summary.

### Phase 5: Budget Tracker
1. **Define Categories**: Pre-set categories and allow user-defined categories.
2. **Track Sub-Items**: Add items under categories (e.g., credit cards under "Credit").
3. **Calculate Totals**: Sum expenses by category and track monthly totals.

### Phase 6: Debt Payoff Tool
1. **Input Form**: Collect debt details (balance, APR, minimum payment).
2. **Implement Snowball Method**:
   - Calculate which debt receives extra payments.
   - Apply extra funds to the smallest debt.
3. **Display Payoff Progress**: Project debt-free date and progress.

### Phase 7: Testing and Deployment
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual modules and functions.
2. **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end flows, including Auth0 and database.
3. **Deployment**: Deploy the app to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expense Prediction**: Use ML to predict future expenses based on trends.
- **Notifications**: Email reminders for payment due dates.
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Enable tracking in different currencies.
- **Mobile App**: Create a mobile version for iOS and Android.
